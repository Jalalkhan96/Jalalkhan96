## Featured Project

### Squid Game (Unity)

## Philosophy

> **“I hate those who don’t help themselves.”**

Growth begins with responsibility.  
Action matters more than intention.

---

## Anime Inspiration

> **“If you don’t fight, you can’t win.”** — *Eren Yeager*

Japanese:
> **戦わなければ、勝てない。**  
> *If you do not fight, you cannot win.*

This mindset reminds me to keep moving forward — in learning, in coding, and in life.
